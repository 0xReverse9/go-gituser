## Overview

User of multiple git accounts, in order to meet my need to switch regularly between these accounts (student, professional, personal), I developed an open source cli (a command line interface) in Golang.

This program helps switch between different git user accounts easily.

![](assets/demo.gif)

It automates the following commands:

```
git config --global user.name "yourUsername"
```

```
git config --global user.email "yourEmail"
```

#### Modes

There is currently 3 modes in this script:

- üíª <b>work</b> : for a work related git account.
- üìö <b>school</b> : for a school related git account.
- üè† <b>personal</b> : for a personal related git account.
